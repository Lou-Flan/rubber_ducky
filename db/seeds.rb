# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# for i in 1..10
#     Listing.create(
#         name: Faker::DcComics.hero,
#         description: Faker::Lorem.paragraph(sentence_count: rand(2..5)),
#         price: Faker::Number.between(from: 1, to: 20)
#         )
#     puts "Created #{i} listings"
# end
